Description
You are required to develop a machine learning system to classify the output as indicated below for any one of the
following datasets.
**Dataset**:CIFAR-10 Images
**title**:Binary classification – Create a new label by
relabeling the outputs into two classes, namely
‘animal’ and ‘vehicle’.
Type of data: Image
Label to be predicted Download link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html



Your assignment should encompass the following requirements:
 Perform all necessary data preprocessing steps on the dataset.
 Implement at least three algorithm: one non-parametric algorithm, one parametric shallow algorithm, one neural
network architecture.
 For each algorithm provide at least 3 models by selecting different values of hyperparameters.
 Ensure proper development and test validations to select the best model.
Also, develop a simple interface (within the notebook) to allow the user to test your system by providing
input and receiving the predicted label in return.
 Report your comparative results for all nine models in both tabular and graphical forms.
 Investigate the effect of changing the data split ratio on the three models selected for each algorithm.
Some Extension Ideas
 Try out more hyperparameters than minimally required.
 Try out more algorithms than minimally required.
 Try out incremental learning. Your interface should provide the user with an additional option of incremental
training. So if user provides a new dataset (similar in structure to the one on which your algorithm was trained
previously), then your algorithm should be able to incorporate the new knowledge. Your code should be able
to perform all required pre-processing steps too on this new dataset.
 Try out some transfer learning techniques.
